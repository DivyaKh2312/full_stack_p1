    Rani Ki Vav (lit.â€‰'The Queen's Stepwell') is a stepwell situated in the town of Patan in Gujarat, India. It is located on the banks of the Saraswati River. Its construction is attributed to Udayamati, the spouse of the 11th-century Chaulukya king Bhima I. Silted over, it was rediscovered in the 1940s and restored in the 1980s by the Archaeological Survey of India. It has been listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India since 2014. The stepwell is designed as an underground shrine or inverted temple; representing the sanctity of water, with the sculptures in the stepwell depicting numerous Hindu deities.

    Prabandha-Chintamani, composed by the Jain monk Merutunga in 1304, mentions: "Udayamati, the daughter of Naravaraha Khengara, built this novel stepwell at Shripattana (Patan) surpassing the glory of the Sahasralinga Tank". According to it, the stepwell was commissioned in 1063 and was completed after 20 years. It is generally assumed that it was built in the memory of Bhima I (r.â€‰c.â€‰1022 â€“ 1064) by his queen Udayamati and probably completed by Udayamati and Karna after his death but whether she was a widow when she commissioned it is disputed. Commissariat puts the date of construction to 1032 based on the architectural similarity to Vimalavasahi temple on Mount Abu built in the same year.

    The Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, with a height of 182 metres (597 feet),[3] near Kevadia in the state of Gujarat, India. It depicts Indian politician and independence activist Sardar Patel (1875â€“1950), who was the first deputy prime minister and home minister of independent India and an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi. Patel played a significant role in the political integration of India. The statue is on the Narmada River in the Kevadiya colony, facing the Sardar Sarovar Dam 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the city of Vadodara.

Sutar and was inaugurated by Modi, then Prime Minister of India, on 31 October 2018, the 143rd anniversary of Patel's birth.
