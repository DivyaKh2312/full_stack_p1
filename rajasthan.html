  <p align="justify">Jodhpur is home to the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort, which overlooks a sea of blue-painted houses. The city's architectural marvels and desert landscapes offer a serene and majestic escape.</p><br>
<p>Jodhpur is a famous tourist spot with a palace, fort, and temples, set in the stark landscape of the Thar Desert. It is also known as the 'Blue City' due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in the old town.[1] The old city circles the Mehrangarh Fort and is bounded by a wall with several gates.[15] Jodhpur lies near the geographic centre of the Rajasthan state, which makes it a convenient base for travel in a region much frequented by tourists. </p></ul>
